# CryptochromeSCA
SCA for the Cryptochrome (CRY)/Photolyase family. The CRYs play a critical role in the eukaryotic circadian clock. This analysis accompanies: Rosensweig C, Reynolds KA, Gao P, Laothamatas I, Shan Y, Ranganathan R, Takahashi JS, Green CB. (2018) "An evolutionary hotspot defines functional differences between CRYPTOCHROMES" Nature Communications v9:1138 

The analysis was performed using the pySCA toolbox, and run inside of a jupyter notebook. To run the analysis completely, a user will first need to install pySCA (https://github.com/reynoldsk/pySCA, for docs see: http://reynoldsk.github.io/pySCA/)

Once this is done, the python notebook can be used to repeat all of the calculations (and generate figures) from Rosensweig et al. 
The html version of the notebook (SCA_Cry_Photolyase-vFin.html) allows the user to view the results without re-running the calculations themselves.
